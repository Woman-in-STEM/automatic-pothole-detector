## Introduction
Asphalt pavements are vulnerable to scenarios such as traffic load, weather conditions, age, poor material used for construction, and a miserable drainage system, exhibiting two major pavement failures such as cracks and potholes. The Automatic Pothole Detector is a step towards solving this serious issue. It will sense these irregularities and alert the driver immediately. When the user sees the indicator, they can act accordingly. Hence, this device can be especially useful in monsoon season when road damage cannot be clearly seen.

## Features
- Working prototype
- Potholes or speed bumps can be accurately detected within a sufficient range.
- The Detector appropriately signals the user based on the severity of the road damage.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO microcontroller
- Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR05 module)
- LEDs

## Usage
- During monsoon season
- At places like construction sites, muddy roads, etc.
- For night drivers
